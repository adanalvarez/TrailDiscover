            "technique": "T1071 - Application Layer Protocol",

            "technique": "T1070 - Indicator Removal",

            "technique": "T1090 - Proxy",
            "reason": "Attackers may use this API to redirect network traffic through external or internal proxies by changing DNS records, which helps conceal the true destination of the traffic and evade monitoring tools."

            "technique": "T1568 - Dynamic Resolution",

            "technique": "T1531 - Account Access Removal",
            "reason": "By modifying or deleting DNS records, attackers can effectively deny legitimate users access to services, redirecting traffic to incorrect or malicious servers, thereby locking out authorized access."

            "technique": "T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information",
            "reason": "Constant manipulation of DNS records may be used to obscure the attacker's activities, making it more challenging for defenders to trace or understand the methods used for command and control or data exfiltration."
