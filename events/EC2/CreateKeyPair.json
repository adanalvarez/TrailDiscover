            "reason": "The creation of a new key pair can facilitate unauthorized access to cloud accounts if an attacker obtains the private key, allowing them to log in and perform actions within the compromised account. By creating a new key pair, attackers can establish valid accounts that can be used to maintain access and evade detection, as the access looks legitimate. Similar to cloud accounts, valid local accounts can be exploited if the attacker uses the key pair to gain access to specific instances or services within the local environment. If the key pair is used to authenticate to domain accounts within the cloud environment, it can provide attackers with persistent access to those accounts, facilitating further malicious activities."
